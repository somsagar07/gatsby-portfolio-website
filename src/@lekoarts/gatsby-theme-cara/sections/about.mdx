### About

##### Currently pursuing Btech in Computer Science at Indian Institute Of Information Technology, Kottayam

I love learning new and better ways to create seamless user experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn.
